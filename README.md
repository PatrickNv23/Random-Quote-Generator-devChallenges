- Where can I see your demo?  
  This frontend challenge was uploaded to the Netlify domains, because it is a very powerful service to upload your React projects to the internet.

- What was your experience?  
  My experience at the end of this challenge has been satisfactory, since it made me review concepts that I had forgotten, it also helped me reinforce my knowledge of React such as React Context, React Router, state management, API requests with fetch, etc.  
  Finally, I reinforced my knowledge of CSS flexbox using CSS modules and adapting the application for different mobile devices.

- What have you learned/improved?  
  I improved my knowledge of custom hooks to reuse them and have a cleaner code, also, I got to know the basics of the React-spring library to make some animations.  
  Finally, I learned how to manage timeout using a loader while data is coming from an api, this way, it allows me to control the information that is displayed on the screen, and avoid rendering components without information.
